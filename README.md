# Ordering Pizza

## Overview
- You have chosen to order a pizza for dinner, and the restaurant offers three different pizza sizes: Small (S), Medium (M), and Large (L). Each size comes with its own base price and an additional cost per topping. The program should ask for the size of the pizza and the number of toppings, then display the final cost.
